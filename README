Java's Proxy class has poor performance under multi-threaded environments.
Under high concurrency it can completely lock a jvm up.

This simple library has a ConcurrentProxy implementation that is basically a copy of Proxy but
changes the caching mechanism from using a HashMap surrounded with hard synchronization to a ConcurrentMap. 
It is a drop in replacement for the Proxy class.
