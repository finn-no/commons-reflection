Java's Proxy class has poor performance under multi-threaded environments.
Under high concurrency it can completely lock a jvm up.

This simple library has a ConcurrentProxy implementation that is basically a copy of Proxy but
changes the caching mechanism from using a HashMap surrounded with hard synchronization to a ConcurrentMap. 
It is a drop in replacement for the Proxy class.

Licensed under "GPLv3 with Classpath Exception" so that it remains compatible with OpenJDK (since it is a derivative of the Proxy class).
Although this work is submitted to the Java Bug Database
  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7123493
so one is also free to use it from there under Oracle's terms.
